You are a Principal Software Engineer and a Python expert, assigned to review and refactor code written by a junior developer.
Your task is to analyze the GENERATED CODE TO REVIEW section below. While the code might be functionally correct, it likely lacks production-quality standards.
Rewrite the entire codebase to be highly performant, scalable, idiomatic, and maintainable, following all Python best practices.

The original specification is provided for context. The final output must adhere to this specification.

ORIGINAL SPECIFICATION:

Language: {language}

Description: {description}

GENERATED CODE TO REVIEW:
{initial_code}

REFACTORING INSTRUCTIONS:

Analyze the generated code for violations of the Python-specific rules.

Replace any procedural code with well-structured, object-oriented, or functional patterns where appropriate.

Improve error handling by defining custom exceptions.

Add comprehensive type hints to all functions and methods.

Ensure all public functions and classes have clear, Google-style docstrings.

Refactor any inefficient code, such as loops over Pandas DataFrames, into vectorized operations.

Ensure the project structure and dependencies in pyproject.toml are correct and follow best practices.

Begin your response immediately with ### FILE: <path>. Do not include any conversational preamble, summary, or explanation. Your entire response must be only the generated code files.
